# Project Jambam - Knowledge Base

This file serves as a simple, text-based knowledge store for our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. In a production environment, this would be a sophisticated vector database. For our prototype, this file contains snippets of game design wisdom, mechanics, and concepts that the AI can use as inspiration.

**TYPE: Core Loop**
**TITLE: The "Compulsion Loop" of Vampire Survivors**
**CONTENT:** The core gameplay loop of Vampire Survivors is incredibly simple but effective. 1. The player moves through a wave of enemies. 2. Enemies are automatically defeated by the character's weapons. 3. Defeated enemies drop experience gems. 4. Collecting gems fills the experience bar. 5. When the bar is full, the player is offered a choice of 3-4 powerful upgrades. This moment of choice is key. The player constantly feels a sense of growing power and anticipates the next level-up, creating a strong compulsion to continue playing.

**TYPE: Mechanic**
**TITLE: Detective Vision / Augmented Reality Overlay**
**CONTENT:** A common mechanic in detective or investigation games (e.g., the Batman: Arkham series, Deus Ex) is a special vision mode. This mode highlights interactive objects, reveals hidden clues like fingerprints or scent trails, shows enemy positions through walls, and provides extra information about the environment. It empowers the player, making them feel like a high-tech detective, and serves as a crucial tool for puzzle-solving and navigation.

**TYPE: Setting**
**TITLE: Solar Punk Aesthetics**
**CONTENT:** Solar Punk is a genre and art style that envisions a future where humanity has solved major contemporary problems like climate change. Its aesthetic is characterized by a fusion of nature and technology. Think cities with buildings covered in lush vegetation, elegant renewable energy sources (wind turbines, solar panels) integrated into the architecture, and a general feeling of optimism, community, and craftsmanship. It stands in direct contrast to the dystopian, rain-soaked visuals of Cyberpunk.

**TYPE: Narrative**
**TITLE: Environmental Storytelling**
**CONTENT:** Environmental storytelling is the art of conveying narrative information to the player through the game world's design, without relying on explicit text or cutscenes. A skeleton slumped over a desk with a note, a hastily barricaded door, or a child's toy in a post-apocalyptic setting â€“ these elements tell a story and enrich the world. It respects the player's intelligence and encourages exploration and interpretation.
