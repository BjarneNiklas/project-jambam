# The Problem: Fragmented, Complex, Inaccessible

Game development today is a labyrinth, excluding millions of aspiring creators and hindering innovation.

*   **High Barrier to Entry:** Traditional engines are powerful but complex, costly, and require significant technical expertise.
*   **Siloed Ecosystems:** Developers are locked into single engine environments, limiting flexibility and cross-platform collaboration.
*   **Untapped AI Potential:** AI's transformative power in content generation and development efficiency is largely underutilized in accessible tools.
*   **Disconnected Communities:** Creators and players struggle to connect, collaborate, and monetize effectively.
*   **Lack of Digital Sovereignty:** Dependence on non-European platforms and tools.
