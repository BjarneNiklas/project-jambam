# Labs in AURAX: Fostering Experimentation and Innovation

## 1. Introduction to Labs in AURAX

The Lab System within AURAX is a dedicated environment designed to support experimentation, scientific inquiry, research, and innovation. It provides a structured framework for users to define, manage, conduct, and document various types of experimental projects.

**Target Audience:**

The Lab System caters to a diverse audience, including:

*   **Creators & Developers:** For prototyping new game mechanics, testing AI behaviors, or exploring innovative interactions.
*   **Researchers:** For conducting formal studies, collecting data, and analyzing results related to gaming, AI, player behavior, and more.
*   **Students & Educators:** As an educational tool for learning about experimental design, research methodologies, and data-driven iteration in a practical context.
*   **Game Jam Participants:** For teams to structure their experimental game development, document their process, and even participate in specialized "scientific track" challenges.

## 2. The Lab Data Model

At the heart of the system is the `Lab` data model, which provides a comprehensive set of attributes to define and track experimental work. Key attributes include:

*   `id`: A unique identifier for the lab.
*   `name`: A user-defined name for the lab.
*   `description`: A detailed explanation of the lab's purpose and scope.
*   `participants`: A list of users involved in the lab.
*   `created`: The date and time the lab was created.
*   `lab_type`: Categorizes the lab based on its general nature (e.g., "AI Experiment", "Data Analysis"). This helps in discovery and understanding the lab's focus.
*   `status`: The current state of the lab (e.g., "Planning", "Active", "Completed", "Archived").
*   `owner_id`: The user ID of the person who created and primarily manages the lab.
*   `research_question` (Optional): A specific question the lab aims to answer. Crucial for focused research.
*   `methodology` (Optional): A description of the methods, procedures, or tools used in the experiment. This can include links or references to specific experimental setups or "minigames".
*   `dataset_input_ref` (Optional): A reference (URL or path) to input datasets or resources used by the lab.
*   `dataset_output_ref` (Optional): A reference (URL or path) where results, generated data, or logs from the experiment are stored. Essential for reproducibility and analysis.
*   `linked_project_id` (Optional): Connects the lab to a broader project within AURAX.
*   `tags` (Optional): Keywords to aid in discovery and categorization.
*   `visibility`: Controls who can see the lab ("Public", "Private", "University-Only").
*   `report_document_link` (Optional): A link to a formal report, paper, or detailed documentation associated with the lab's findings.
*   `version`: A version string (e.g., "1.0.0", "0.2.0-beta") to track iterations and changes to the lab's setup or methodology.
*   `game_jam_id` (Optional): Links the lab to a specific game jam event.

**Significance of Fields:** These attributes are designed to encourage a systematic approach to experimentation. Fields like `research_question`, `methodology`, and `dataset_output_ref` are particularly important for ensuring clarity, reproducibility, and the effective documentation of experimental work.

## 3. Key Features

The Lab System offers several features to facilitate the experimental workflow:

*   **Lab Discovery:** Users can find existing labs through:
    *   **Search:** Keyword search across lab names, descriptions, and tags.
    *   **Filters:** Filtering labs based on `lab_type`, `status`, and `visibility`.
*   **Lab Creation:** Users can easily create new labs by providing information for the fields described in the data model. This allows for a clear definition of the experiment's goals and setup from the outset.
*   **Lab Participation:** Users can be added as participants to labs, enabling collaborative work. (Current implementation allows joining/leaving for any user, future enhancements could add roles and permissions).
*   **Lab Editing:** Lab owners have the ability to modify the details of their labs as experiments evolve or to correct information.
*   **Versioning:** The `version` field is crucial for tracking iterations. As an experiment's parameters, methodology, or scope change, updating the version helps maintain a clear history of the lab's development.

## 4. Lab Types and Experiments

The `lab_type` attribute provides a way to categorize labs and give an initial indication of their nature and how they might be interacted with.

**Example Lab Types:**

*   **AI Experiment:** For testing and developing AI models, behaviors, or algorithms (e.g., pathfinding, decision-making, generative AI).
*   **Data Analysis:** Focused on analyzing existing datasets to derive insights or answer specific questions.
*   **Game Design Challenge:** Often used in game jams or educational settings, where the "experiment" is to create a game or prototype under specific constraints or themes.
*   **Physics Sandbox:** For experimenting with physics simulations, material properties, or environmental interactions.
*   **Community Research:** Labs designed to gather feedback, conduct surveys, or analyze player behavior within the AURAX community.

**Launching and Managing Experiments:**

The way an experiment is "run" can vary significantly based on its `lab_type`:

*   **Integrated Experiments (e.g., LegoGPT Lab):** Some labs, like the "LegoGPT Lab," have a custom, dedicated interface integrated directly into AURAX. Users interact with this interface to conduct the experiment (e.g., enter prompts, see generated 3D models). The `LegoGptLabPage` is an example of such an interface, tailored to the specifics of that particular lab's function.
*   **Minigame-Based Labs (e.g., "Prompt2Asset" Concept):** A powerful concept is to link labs to "minigames" or standardized experimental setups. For instance, a "Prompt2Asset Lab" would allow a user to define their research question (e.g., "Which art style keywords generate the most coherent fantasy landscapes?") and then use a standardized "Prompt2Asset" minigame interface to input prompts, generate images, and automatically log these (prompt + image) to their lab's `dataset_output_ref`.
*   **External Tools & Manual Data Collection:** Some labs might involve experiments conducted using external tools or manual data collection. In such cases, the AURAX Lab System serves as the primary hub for documenting the methodology, linking to external resources/data, and reporting findings.

**"Launch Experiment" Placeholder:**
For certain `lab_type`s (like 'AI Experiment', 'Physics Sandbox') where an interactive component is implied but not yet custom-built, a "Launch Experiment" button placeholder is visible on the `LabDetailPage`. This signifies the future potential to either link to a specific experimental interface (like a minigame) or provide tools to manage the lifecycle of an executable experiment. The `methodology` field might eventually contain information (e.g., a URL or an internal identifier) that activates this button, pointing it to the correct experimental environment.

## 5. Use Cases

The Lab System in AURAX can be leveraged in various scenarios:

**For Universities:**

*   **Research Projects:** Facilitate research in areas like AI model behavior in games, procedural content generation, game design efficacy studies, human-computer interaction, and player behavior analysis.
*   **Educational Tool:** Provide students with a hands-on platform to design experiments, collect data (simulated or real), analyze results, and understand research principles in game development and interactive media.
*   **Inter-University Collaboration:** Labs with "University-Only" or "Public" visibility can serve as shared spaces for collaborative research projects between institutions.
*   **Showcasing Research:** Completed labs with public reports can act as a portfolio of research outcomes.

**For Game Jams:**

*   **Themed Experiments:** Host game jams with themes that encourage experimental design (e.g., "AI for Emergent Narratives," "Data-Driven Game Balancing").
*   **Process Documentation:** Labs provide a framework for game jam teams to document their experimental approaches, iterations, and findings during the jam.
*   **Scientific Track Prizes:** Enable game jams to have a "scientific track" where labs are judged based on their experimental rigor, documentation, and insights, alongside the game itself.
*   **Post-Jam Iteration:** Teams can continue to use their lab setup to iterate on their game jam prototype based on collected data or further experimentation.

**For Individual Creators/Researchers:**

*   **Prototyping & Feedback:** Test innovative game mechanics, AI systems, or interactive experiences and document the process and outcomes.
*   **A/B Testing:** Set up labs to conduct A/B tests for different game features, UI designs, or gameplay parameters, using `dataset_output_ref` to store results for comparison.
*   **Personal Research:** Pursue independent research projects, using the Lab System to structure their work and potentially share findings with the community.

## 6. Future Vision

The Lab System is envisioned to grow with more advanced features, including:
