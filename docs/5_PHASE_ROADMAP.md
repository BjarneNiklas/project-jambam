## 🎮 Development Logic

### **Why This Order?**

#### **Phase 1-2: Foundation First**
```
Ideation → Asset Generation → Engine Integration
```
- **Without Ideation** = No concepts to work with
- **Without Assets** = No content for engines
- **Without Engine Adapters** = No deployment capability

#### **Phase 3-4: Integration & Collaboration**
```
Engine Adapters → Advanced AI → Collaboration
```
- **Engine Adapters** = Technical foundation
- **Advanced AI** = Intelligent features
- **Collaboration** = Community building

#### **Phase 5: Market Leadership**
```
European Focus → Educational → Enterprise
```
- **European Market** = Local advantage
- **Educational** = Community growth
- **Enterprise** = Monetization
