# LUVY Engine (Project Jambam) - Platform Overview

Welcome to the central documentation hub for the LUVY Engine (also known as Project Jambam)! This document provides a high-level overview of the project and serves as a starting point for navigating our comprehensive documentation.

**Recommendation:** It's advisable to standardize the project name. While "LUVY Engine" appears more in technical documents and "Project Jambam" in community/style guides, a single, consistent name used everywhere would improve clarity.

## Vision & Goals

The LUVY Engine is an open, modular, and mobile-first platform designed for the next generation of interactive media and game development. Our core mission is to democratize game creation, making game jams, co-creation, and advanced development processes accessible to everyone, regardless of prior experience.

We aim to foster a vibrant community by providing powerful tools, AI-assisted workflows, and a flexible architecture that supports both rapid prototyping and professional, long-term game development.

Key goals include:
*   **Community-Driven Development:** Empowering users to contribute, share, and collaborate.
*   **AI-Powered Creativity:** Integrating advanced AI to assist in idea generation, content creation, and workflow optimization.
*   **Engine Agnosticism:** Providing tools and pipelines (like the Universal Engine Adapter) to reduce vendor lock-in and support multiple game engines.
*   **Accessibility & Inclusivity:** Ensuring the platform is usable and welcoming to a diverse range of creators.
*   **Comprehensive Tooling:** Offering a complete ecosystem from ideation to published game.

*   **Key Systems:**
    *   **Mindflow AI Engine:** The core AI system.
        *   [AI Architecture Blueprint](./features/ai/ai_architecture_blueprint.md): Describes the hybrid SLM+LLM+RAG AI model.
        *   [AI Overview & Resources](./features/ai/ai_overview.md): Lists potential AI models and applications.
    *   **Universal Engine Adapter:** Aims to enable content creation once for multiple game engines.
        *   [Engine Adapter Architecture](./features/engines/engine_adapter_architecture.md): Details the vision for this system using OpenUSD.
    *   **ProjectMasterAgent:** The central meta-agent for managing project information.
        *   [ProjectMasterAgent Details](./features/general/project_master_agent.md): Explains its role and capabilities.

## User & Contributor Guides

*   **Styling & UI/UX:**
    *   [Style Guide](./features/general/style_guide.md): Defines the visual design, color palette, typography, and UI principles for Project Jambam.
*   **Contributing to the Project:**
    *   [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md): Essential reading for anyone wanting to contribute to the LUVY Engine. Covers setup, workflow, coding style, and commit conventions.

## Development & Technical Documentation

*   **Repository Structure (Proposed Refactor):**
    *   [Repository Structure Proposal](./features/general/repository_structure.md): Outlines a proposed future refactoring of the project's directory structure. *(Note: This describes a target state, not the current one.)*
*   **API Documentation:**
    *   [Backend API (OpenAPI)](../api/openapi.yaml): The OpenAPI specification for the Python backend. (Note: also viewable at `api/README.md`)
*   **Developer Guide:**
    *   [Developer Guide](./development/developer_guide.md): Information on setting up the development environment and other developer-specific guidelines. *(Note: Content may need review and updates based on current practices.)*

## Roadmap & Future Ideas

*   [Feature Ideas Collection](./features/general/feature_ideas.md): Contains a list of specific feature concepts that have been brainstormed (e.g., "Hidden Gifts," Hub customizations). This list can serve as input for a more structured roadmap.
*   [Future Concepts & Creative Ideas](./FUTURE_CONCEPTS.md): Explores more conceptual, forward-looking ideas that leverage the LUVY Engine's unique architecture, such as "Jam Intel" and "ArchVizAI".
*   **Future Vision:** Developing a comprehensive roadmap document (e.g., `docs/ROADMAP.md`) that outlines planned features, their priorities, and estimated timelines would be highly beneficial for transparency and community alignment. This could incorporate existing ideas and provide a clearer path forward.

This overview is intended to grow and adapt with the project. We encourage you to explore the linked documents to gain a deeper understanding of the LUVY Engine.
