# Project Jambam

### (Jamba M â€” BAM: Building Autonomous Metaverse)

*Your AI Co-Creator for Game Jams and the Metaverse*

## Vision

Project Jambam aims to democratize and accelerate the entire development process of interactive 3D applications (games, simulations, metaverse building blocks) by providing an AI-powered co-creation platform. It aspires to be a "GitHub Copilot for the 3D world" with strong community aspects, especially tailored for events like game jams.

## Core Features

Project Jambam is built upon four foundational pillars:

1.  **The Concept Forge (AI Innovation Assistant):** Generates complete "Jam Kits" (themes, quests, descriptions, asset suggestions) on demand, based on user input, scientific contexts, and market trends.
2.  **The JamFam (Community & Gamification):** A vibrant ecosystem where users can propose, vote on, and collaboratively develop themes and ideas. Meaningful gamification will reward quality contributions.
3.  **Open Architecture:** A cross-platform application (Mobile, Web, Desktop) with an API-first design, enabling future integration with any game engine (Unity, Godot, etc.) via plugins.
4.  **Long-Term Roadmap:** The evolution from an ideation tool towards an explorable 3D marketplace (built on OpenUSD) and a multi-engine development platform.

## Tech Stack

The initial frontend framework for Project Jambam is **Flutter** (using the Dart programming language). This choice was made due to its strong cross-platform capabilities, allowing for a single codebase across multiple platforms.

## Getting Started

(This section is a placeholder and will be updated with detailed instructions.)

To get started with Project Jambam, you'll need to have Flutter installed on your system.

1.  **Install Flutter:** Follow the official Flutter installation guide: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-jambam.git
    cd project-jambam
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
4.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for its Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

The pipeline is triggered on every push and pull request to the `main` branch and performs the following steps:

1.  **Checkout Repository:** Fetches the latest code.
2.  **Setup Flutter:** Initializes the Flutter environment, using a stable channel and caching dependencies to speed up subsequent runs.
3.  **Print Flutter Version:** Displays the Flutter version for debugging purposes.
4.  **Install Dependencies:** Runs `flutter pub get` to install all project dependencies.
5.  **Run Static Analysis:** Executes `flutter analyze` to check for code style issues, potential bugs, and other linting warnings.
6.  **Check Formatting:** Runs `flutter format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .` to ensure the code adheres to Dart formatting guidelines. The build will fail if any files need reformatting.
7.  **Run Tests:** Executes all unit and widget tests using `flutter test --coverage --machine`. Test results are saved in `test-results.json`.
8.  **Upload Test Results:** Uploads `test-results.json` as a build artifact.
9.  **Upload Coverage Report:** Uploads the `coverage/lcov.info` file (generated by the test command) as a build artifact. This report can be used with tools like Coveralls or SonarQube to track code coverage.
10. **Build Android APK (on main push):** If the workflow is triggered by a push to the `main` branch, it builds a release APK for Android using `flutter build apk --release`.
11. **Upload Android APK (on main push):** The generated `app-release.apk` is uploaded as a build artifact.
12. **Build Web App (on main push):** If the workflow is triggered by a push to the `main` branch, it builds a release version of the web application using `flutter build web --release`.
13. **Upload Web Build (on main push):** The contents of the `build/web` directory are uploaded as a build artifact.

Build artifacts such as test results, coverage reports, APKs, and web builds can be downloaded from the summary page of each workflow run in the GitHub Actions tab.
