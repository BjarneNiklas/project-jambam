# Project Jambam

### (Jamba M â€” BAM: Building Autonomous Metaverse)

*Your AI Co-Creator for Game Jams and the Metaverse*

## Vision

Project Jambam aims to democratize and accelerate the entire development process of interactive 3D applications (games, simulations, metaverse building blocks) by providing an AI-powered co-creation platform. It aspires to be a "GitHub Copilot for the 3D world" with strong community aspects, especially tailored for events like game jams.

## Core Features

Project Jambam is built upon four foundational pillars:

1.  **The Concept Forge (AI Innovation Assistant):** Generates complete "Jam Kits" (themes, quests, descriptions, asset suggestions) on demand, based on user input, scientific contexts, and market trends.
2.  **The JamFam (Community & Gamification):** A vibrant ecosystem where users can propose, vote on, and collaboratively develop themes and ideas. Meaningful gamification will reward quality contributions.
3.  **Open Architecture:** A cross-platform application (Mobile, Web, Desktop) with an API-first design, enabling future integration with any game engine (Unity, Godot, etc.) via plugins.
4.  **Long-Term Roadmap:** The evolution from an ideation tool towards an explorable 3D marketplace (built on OpenUSD) and a multi-engine development platform.

## Tech Stack

The initial frontend framework for Project Jambam is **Flutter** (using the Dart programming language). This choice was made due to its strong cross-platform capabilities, allowing for a single codebase across multiple platforms.
