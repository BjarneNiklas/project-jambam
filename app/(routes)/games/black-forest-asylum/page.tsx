        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Game Overview</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Black Forest Asylum is a community-driven psychological horror and mystery game.
          Set in an abandoned, isolated asylum deep within Germany's Black Forest, the game invites
          players to explore a place with a dark past, filled with unethical experiments and whispered legends
          of strange occurrences.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project emphasizes immersive exploration, detailed environmental storytelling, and
          challenging puzzles, all while building a pervasive sense of dread and vulnerability.

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Setting & Atmosphere</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The asylum itself is a key character â€“ a historical, imposing structure now decaying and
          haunted by its history. Players might take on roles such as an urban explorer, a paranormal
          investigator, or someone with a personal tie to the asylum's past.
        </p>
        <p>
          The horror is primarily psychological, relying on atmosphere, unsettling sound design
          (creaking structures, distant whispers), and the unfolding narrative rather than frequent jump scares.
          A potential supernatural element, the psychic residue of past trauma, may manifest in various unsettling ways.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Immersive Exploration:</strong> Discover the asylum's secrets by navigating its decaying halls,
            wards, and hidden areas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Environmental Storytelling:</strong> Piece together the narrative through scattered notes,
            patient diaries, staff logs, medical records, audio recordings, and environmental clues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Challenging Puzzles:</strong> Solve puzzles that often require understanding the asylum's
            history or the tormented minds of its former inhabitants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Limited Resources:</strong> Players may often rely on limited light sources like flashlights
            or candles, enhancing the sense of vulnerability.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Visual & Audio Style</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Visuals:</strong> Dark, oppressive, and highly detailed environments. A realistic art style
            focusing on decay and the passage of time. Dynamic lighting will be crucial.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Audio:</strong> Critical immersive sound design featuring ambient sounds of the old building,
            subtle unsettling noises, and a potentially adaptive soundtrack. Voice acting for audio logs
            will enhance immersion.
          </li>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">A Community-Developed Project</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Black Forest Asylum is envisioned as a collaborative effort, inviting contributions from
          game developers, writers, artists, and sound designers. The asylum's modular design
          (distinct wings like administrative, patient wards, labs) lends itself well to this approach.
        </p>
        <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Contribution Opportunities Include:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Designing individual rooms or entire sections with unique stories and puzzles.</li>
          <li>Writing narrative fragments (case files, journals, letters).</li>
          <li>Developing logic puzzles and environmental riddles.</li>
          <li>Creating 2D and 3D assets.</li>
          <li>Contributing ambient soundscapes or musical pieces.</li>
          <li>Developing optional side narratives and character backstories.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-3">
          The goal is to create a rich, multi-layered horror experience where the main narrative is
          enhanced by diverse community contributions, making the asylum feel vast and filled with
          countless tragic stories.
