        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Core Concepts</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Co-Creation & Block-Based Worlds:</strong> Inspired by games like Minecraft and Roblox, LUVY
            emphasizes user-generated content within immersive, block-based environments. This includes
            tools for easy and efficient assembly of structures and landscapes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flexible and Future-Proof Architecture:</strong> The platform is being built with a modular and
            adaptable architecture. This ensures it can evolve with new technologies, integrate with other tools,
            and potentially be adopted or expanded by larger entities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AI-Powered Procedural Generation:</strong> Leveraging artificial intelligence for procedural
            generation of textures, 3D models, level layouts, and even music & sound effects to accelerate
            content creation and offer unique experiences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Education and E-Learning Integration:</strong> LUVY aims to incorporate robust e-learning
            modules, making complex topics like history, mathematics, and coding accessible and engaging.
            This includes concepts like "Studi.OS" â€“ an operating system for education.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Community-Driven Development:</strong> Encouraging community contributions, project forking,
            and modding, supported by robust project management tools and communication channels like Discord.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gamification & Engagement:</strong> Implementing gamification frameworks and elements across
            the platform to enhance user engagement, from learning modules to social interactions.
